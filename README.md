# JSON-Model

The JSON-Model library allows you to save and load JSON Data from disk. It also mirrors some of Laravel's one-to-one and many-to-many/one relations so you can reference other files.

## Notes

This is far from production ready, do not use (yet).

## Todo List

- [ ] Move to a proper UUID package
- [ ] Define tests
- [ ] Let the developer specify the json output directory
- [ ] Create documentation
